The importance of friendship is recognised by most people, of having people of similar interests to turn to socially, outside of family. Even so, the significance of friends can vary throughout life's journey.  
  
In the first place, friendships usually matter the most during youth, while being in school or university. When you are at school, your friends are the ones with whom you discuss the decisions and things that matter. By having an age gap with your parents and other adults in the family it is much harder to understand each other. Similarly, friendships formed during university life are extremely deep and usually last long because of shared experiences of being away from home and the freedom there is to bond with friends, not being limited by parents.

However, during adulthood, friendships may carry a lesser role. Because of the responsibilities of being an adult by taking care of your family, having a full-time job and managing possible loans for houses, there is not a lot of time to take care of friends and meet up with them, maybe seeing them only every other week. Because of the built-up stress of having an adult life and having no time for yourself, even if new friendships are formed during work or you see older friends again, they are not as close as those in your youth, because they each have their responsibilities and problems like you.  
  
In conclusion, it is fair to say that during your youth, friends play a vital role in life but their importance often diminishes with the responsibilities of adult life.
